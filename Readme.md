#### Pi Voice Assistant

Raspberry Pi personal voice assistant implemented in python that works primarily by using the Wolfram Alpha and wit.ai APIs. There is Spotify control which is implemented using mopidy - a service that allowed me to convert the Pi into a music streaming server.

The assistant is implemented in Python but there is incomplete C++ code that I may complete for practice reasons. 

Hardware used in this project:
+ Raspberry Pi B
+ Wi-Fi adapter
+ USB Microphone to take in audio input
+ Audio output (speakers)

Future plans:
+ Implement more actions (e.g. basic home automation services)
+ Stream music from more online services (using mopidy)
+ Build case and improve/tweak automation 
	- Possibly have a button that activates wit.ai client
	- Convert search results to voice
